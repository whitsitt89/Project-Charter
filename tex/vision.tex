This team has been assigned the task of making a blue tooth based hydrometer for the capstone class of Senior Design.  The hydrometer we are designing will address the issue that normal hydrometers have when brewing beer.  This product shall be placed into the fermentation vat, and will prevent the need to take a sample or open the vat, reducing contamination.  The hydrometer will link to a local sever, and the server will provide a mobile web user interface.

The end vision is to have a thermohydrometer that is able to be enclosed into the fermentation vat for the entire fermentation life cycle.  A local server will receive, gather, manipulate, and store all information.  A mobile web environment will provide a user interface with the hydrometer information as a display.
