The mission of this project is to provide a solution to home brewers everywhere.  There is a challenge with testing for the sugar content in the brewing process currently.  A sample of the fermenting liquid must be taken to measure the specific gravity.  This causes two issues; the sample is wasted and the entire batch is exposed to contamination.  The aim of this project is to help solve this issue.

This project will be a blue tooth based thermohydrometer.  It will reside in the fermentation tank with the liquid for the whole life cycle of fermentation.  This will prevent loss of fermenting liquid and lower the risk of contamination.  The hydrometer will interact with a local based server, which will be placed on a raspberry pi 3.

There will be a mobile web user interface component as well.  This will allow all home brewers to be able to utilize this product.  The website will get read all information from the server and display it for ease of use.  The mobile versions of the website will display the information as well, and be available in the android and IOS systems.
